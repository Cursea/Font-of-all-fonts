# Font-of-all-fonts

'Font of all Fonts' is a portfolio project which aims to clone [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

This is a React conversion of my _incomplete_ ['Favourite-Fonts'](https://github.com/Cursea/Favourite-Fonts) Chingu solo project, moving it from Tier 1 (HTML, CSS, vanilla JS) to Tier 2 (full frontend using a framework of my choice).

See [ProjectRequirements.md](ProjectRequirements.md) for progress.
